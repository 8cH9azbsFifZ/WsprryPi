Credits goes to Oliver Mattos and Oskar Weigl who implemented PiFM [1]
based on the idea of exploiting RPi DPLL as FM transmitter. Dan MD1CLV
combined this effort with WSPR encoding algorithm from F8CHK, resulting
in WsprryPi a WSPR beacon for LF and MF bands. Guido PE1NNZ extended
this effort with DMA based PWM modulation of fractional divider that was
part of PiFM, allowing to operate the WSPR beacon also on HF and VHF bands.
In addition time-synchronisation and double amount of power output was
implemented.
